# Stock Count Frontend Implementation

## Overview
Implemented a complete stock counting workflow in the frontend, integrated with the backend API.

## Components Created

### 1. StartStockCountModal
**Location:** `src/components/inventory/StartStockCountModal.tsx`

**Features:**
- Fetches and displays available warehouse locations
- Radio button selection of warehouse location
- Validates location selection
- Calls POST `/api/inventory/stock-count/sessions` to start session
- Navigates to Stock Count Session page on success
- Loading states and error handling

**Integration:**
- Added to `InventorySection.tsx`
- Triggered by "Perform Stock Count" card on dashboard

---

### 2. StockCountSessionPage
**Location:** `src/pages/StockCountSessionPage.tsx`

**Features:**

#### Session Header
- Session number and location name display
- Real-time progress bar (counted / total batches)
- Back button to return to dashboard
- Finalize button (disabled until all items resolved)

#### Batch Scanning
- Barcode scanner input (keyboard or scanner device)
- Scans batch number and auto-selects matching line
- Visual feedback for scan results

#### Batch List
- Grid view of all batches to count
- Status indicators:
  - ✅ Counted (green)
  - ❌ Not Found (red)
  - ⚠️ Location Mismatch (yellow warning)
  - ⏳ Pending (gray)
- Expected quantity display
- Discrepancy display for counted items
- Click to select batch for counting

#### Count Entry Panel
- Sticky panel on right side
- Shows selected batch details
- Location mismatch warning (if applicable)
- Count quantity input
- Record button with validation
- Calls PATCH `/api/inventory/stock-count/lines/record`

#### Session Finalization
- Validates all items counted or marked not found
- Prevents finalization if pending items exist
- Confirmation dialog
- Calls POST `/api/inventory/stock-count/sessions/:id/finalize`
- Returns to dashboard on success

---

## Routing

### Added Route
```tsx
<Route path="/stock-count/:sessionId" element={<StockCountSessionPage />} />
```

**URL Pattern:** `/stock-count/{session-uuid}`

---

## User Workflow

1. **Dashboard** → Click "Perform Stock Count" card
2. **Start Modal** → Select warehouse location → Click "Start Counting"
3. **Session Page** → Scan batches or click to select
4. **Count Entry** → Enter counted quantity → Record
5. **Finalize** → Review progress → Click "Finalize Session"
6. **Return to Dashboard** → Adjustments created for manager approval

---
